# Leverage
Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. Code and media are permissionless leverage. Theyâ€™re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

How to create real wealth in tech from zero:
1. Learn skills that make your time valuable.
2. Leverage your skills and time for cash.
3. Leverage your skills, time, and cash for a network.
4. Leverage your skills, time, cash and network for ownership (equity).

A simple question that can deliver powerful results if taken seriously:
*What is the highest leverage action I can execute on right now?*
