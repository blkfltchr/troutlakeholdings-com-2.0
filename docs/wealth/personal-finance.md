# Personal finance

The average person's cash flow looks like this: ~~Earn -> Spend -> Build Wealth~~  
The "secret" to becoming wealthy is to make it look like this: **Earn -> Build Wealth -> Spend...**

No matter how many financial books you read or podcasts you listen to, you’ll always come across the same simple path to building wealth:
1. Spend less than you earn.
2. Invest the difference.
3. Compound for years until wealthy.

In terms of how you can actually pursue this path to wealth, try following the steps below:
1. Get your “big three” expenses of housing, transportation, and food under control.
2. Acquire a rare skill set and use it to earn a high income.
3. Buy and create assets that pay you over and over again.
