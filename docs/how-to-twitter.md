## Daily checklist

1. 3 tweets per day
2. 6 comments under large accounts per day
3. 2 threads per week

## Prompts

ü§Ø Can you share an interesting epiphany that you had?  
üõ†Ô∏è What are you building right now?  
üåÄ Can you explain a confusing topic in a simple way?  
üìà If you were 2 steps ahead of where you are, what advice would you give yourself?  
üéì What have you learned recently?  
üí¨ Have you been inspired by a recent conversation?  
üÜö What is a recent decision you made and why?  
‚ú® What is something interesting that happened today?  

## Style

1.  Nail the hook & rhythm. Every word counts, just like a poem.
2.  Every tweet should be about just one idea, no matter how long it is. Start with a simple sentence. Then elaborate.
3.  Write the kinds of tweets you‚Äôd like to see, don't write tweets that would annoy you.

## What to measure 

-> Tweet engagement  
-> Profile conversion rate

I use engagement to figure out what topics & approaches work.

I use profile conversion (new followers) to see if people want to sign up to see more.

## Networking

Have a favorite account you follow?

Reach out! 

Comment on their posts, share their content with others, add insight to the conversation.  

Ask what YOU can do for them.

Do this & you'll get noticed.

### Growing through comments

- Find 10-30 big accounts who have the followers that you want.
- Follow them and turn notifications on.
- Engage, share their content, add insight, make friends.
- Add value: be entertaining, add personal experience, and share your results.

*Bonus*   
- Find who leaves interesting comments on the big accounts.
- Go to their profile to ‚Äútweets and replies‚Äù tab. 
- Check what they‚Äôre commenting on other accounts. Model them.

### Growing through DMs

- Expand on tweet + asks a question
- Show what you can bring to the table and maybe do a collab
- Send them something interesting about their field
- Tell them you used their advice and it actually worked
