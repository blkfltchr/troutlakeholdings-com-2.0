# Michael Karnjanaprakorn on PHCs

## How he describes personal holding companies

Multiple businesses. All under one company.

Mix between cashflow and equity. From startups to laundromats to real estate. 

Profits flow up to the HoldCo and get reinvested to build new projects and buy more businesses.

## Why he loves PHCs

You can create them to suit whatever strategy, risk profile or fun projects that you want to do.

No longer have to put all your eggs in one basket.

Can work on your own terms.

## How he would staff a PHC

I would break the teams up into the following:

- Content
- Family Office: Investing, Taxes, Accounting, Admin
- Studio: Incubating ideas from 0 to 1

Then have separate teams for each company with a CEO.

## How he's deploying capital in late 2022

50% cash and T-bills in 3/6/9 month increments until I figure out what I'm going to be doing.

Most likely starting or buying companies.
