# Learning

The number one meta skill - **Learning How To Learn**.

## The Feynman Technique

To learn anything:  
  
Step 1: Identify a topic.  
Step 2: Try to explain it to a 5-year-old.  
Step 3: Study to fill in knowledge gaps.  
Step 4: Organize, convey, and review.  
  
True genius is the ability to simplify, not complicate.  
  
Simple is beautiful.

### Remembering everything you learn

Step 1: Write down the concept you want to learn at the top.  
Step 2: Simplify for a 5 year old: What is it? How does it work? Why is it important?  
Step 3: After your first draft, review: Where did you blank? What did you misunderstand?  
Step 4: Go back to the source material and refine. Chip away until itâ€™s clean, clear, and concise.  

## New way of learning
Old way: learn learn learn learn learn do

*Read only what you need to for learning. Execute. Make mistakes. Repeat.*
