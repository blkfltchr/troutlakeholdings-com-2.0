1. Focus mostly on building new businesses. Aim to build one new business each year.

2. If buying a business, pay no more than 3-5x EBITDA, use seller financing. Must have low hanging fruit to grow cash flows by modernizing marketing and standardizing operations.

3. Most of the cashflow generated from the businesses will roll up to the HoldCo to be reinvested into steps 2 and 3.

4. For every 2-3 businesses deals, invest in 1 real estate deal.

5. Invest excess cash in ETFs and t-bills while searching for new opportunities.

6. Keep repeating steps 1 through 4 to compound capital.
