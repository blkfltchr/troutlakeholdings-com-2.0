## Where we stayed:

Between 10eme and 2eme arrondissement 

Very walkable to Le Marais and Canal St Martin

## Drinks and small bites:

**Le Barav in Le Marais** - Hip, busy bar connected to a wine shop. Buy a bottle and eat some cheese. \*Certified Ez top pick\*

**Septime La Cave in 11eme** - Small wine cellar with limited seats and standing room on the street. Owned by restaurants Septime and Clamato (didn’t try either but recommend trying to reserve ahead of time).

**Le Mary Celeste in Le Marais** - Great cocktails, small menu, kept bringing us things we didn’t order, still highly recommend.

**Le Baron Rouge in 11eme** - Nice spot for a glass of wine post cheese at Marche des Enfants.

## Markets:

**Marche des Enfants Rouges in Le Marais** - France’s oldest covered market. Produce outside, Cheese (the good stuff) inside. We went to the fromagerie and ordered 4 different cheeses to go with bread from a nearby bakery.

**Marche aux puces / Saint Ouen Flea Market in 18eme** - Get lost in a huge flea market with lots of vendors. Recommend spending a few hours here, lots to browse. \*Certified Ez top pick\*

## Sightseeing:

**Sacre Couer in 18eme** - Possibly the best free view in Paris. Recommend going for sunset, bring wine. Tie it into walking around Montmartre, the cool surrounding neighborhood.

**Eiffel Tower in 7eme** - Self explanatory. At night it lights up and flashes around 11 PM, worth a look.

**Musee D’orsay in 7eme** - Great collection of impressionism and post impressionism in an old train station - Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Degas, Rodin.

**Musee de l’orangerie in 8eme** - Smaller collection but holds huge curved panels of Monet’s water Lillies - Picasso, Monet, Manet.

**Canal St Martin in Le Marais** - Nice place to stroll or sit with coffee and pastry.

**Champs Elysees in 8eme** - Bougie shops that end at the Arc du Triomphe.

**Jardin du Luxumberg in 6eme** - Impressive park, nice for a stroll. Tennis courts, pond where kids rent mini sail boats, picturesque.

## Nightlife:

**Le Chat Noir in 11eme** - Quirky spoken word night, open mic and live poetry in the basement.

**38Riv in Le Marais** - Live music in what feels like an underground wine cellar, arrive early to get a seat. Weekly mix of bands and jam sessions (which is what we saw and was amazing). 

## Boulangerie:

**Du Pain et des idées in Le Marais** - Award winning patisseries, sells out early so arrive before 10, if possible.

## Restaurants:

**La Verre Volie in 10eme** - Wine bistro beside the canal, small menu. Pricey but sooo good, worth splurging for. Blake’s favourite meal.

**L’as du falafel in Le Marais** - Famous falafel / shawarma spot known to have long lines. Go at off hours like 3 or 4 pm to avoid waiting.

**Cafe du flore in 6eme** - Traditional Paris cafe: big salads, omelettes, etc., worth the wait for a table outside.

**L’ilot in Le Marais** - Very good seafood restaurant, loved everything we ordered. \*Certified Ez top pick\*

## Places we wish we went but didn’t have time to go:

**Bourse de commerce, Versailles, Grand Mosque de Paris, Perrotin Gallery**

## Restaurants we wish we went but didn’t have time to go:

**Le Train Bleu, Clamato, Septime, Bistro Paul Bert, Les enfants du marche (seafood in marche des enfants rouges), Le Servant**
