## What is a holding company?
A holding company is a company that is not actively operating. Instead of selling any goods or services, a holding company (HoldCo) hold shares of other companies and investments.

The core goal of a holding company is to compound capital by building and buying cash flowing businesses and reinvesting the profits.

**HoldCo benefit #1 - Tax-free dividends:**
In Canada, there are [tax rules](https://kalfalaw.com/tax-free-inter-corporate-dividends/) allowing for tax-free dividends between Canadian Controlled Private Corporations.

**HoldCo benefit #2 - Efficient reinvestment:**
Owners get to  make investments through HoldCos before paying income taxes rather than doing so personally with after tax income.

**HoldCo benefit #3 - Timing income:**
Owners can draw money out of HoldCos when they want it, particularly in years when the owner's personal income is lower.

**HoldCo benefit #4 - Creditor protection:**
Owners can protect earnings and subsequent investments from creditors. It's harder for creditors of an operating company to go after funds if they are held in a separate legal entity.

**HoldCo drawback #1 - Increased costs and admin:**
A HoldCo will require a corporate lawyer who can help draft the documents of incorporation and legal filings each year. A holding company adds a level of complexity which requires more reliance on accountants and more time and attention from the owner.

## How to structure a holding company

**Corporate structure of a typical operating company**

- Business owners hold shares of the OpCo directly
- Excess earnings from the OpCo can be distributed to shareholders in the form of *taxable dividends*
- Excess earnings that are not needed to fund business owners' personal expenses are kept within the OpCo
- Personal income tax is deferred so more of these earnings can be reinvested to grow over time

**Corporate structure of a typical holding company**

- Business owners hold shares of a HoldCo is introduced in between the OpCo and the shareholder(s) to hold shares of the OpCo(s)
- Excess earnings from the OpCo flow to the HoldCo in the form of *tax-free dividends* (dividends are generally not taxed if the HoldCo owns more than 10% of the OpCo)
- Excess earnings from the HoldCo can be distributed to shareholders in the form of *taxable dividends*
- Excess earnings that are not needed to fund business owners' personal expenses are kept within the HoldCo
- Personal income tax is deferred so more of these earnings can be reinvested to grow over time

The value of an opportunity to defer tax can be significant; each dollar that is not lost to income tax can be invested and potentially grow over time.

## How to distribute cash from an operating company to a holding company
Ideally, an operating company should have two bank accounts:
- The operating account, a day-to-day checking account
- The capital account, a rainy day fund and an account to pay dividends to the HoldCo. 

Generally, OpCos keep only the smallest amount needed in the capital account, essentially 1-2 months worth of operating expenses. At the end of each month, you distribute anything above that amount. 

This strategy, also referred to as a ‘cash sweep’, allows for investment of profits in a portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments in a company that is protected from liability and high tax rates.

It gives business owners up to fifty-cents on every dollar of increased investment earning capacity, helping grow their money at a much quicker rate than if it were extracted personally and invested in a personal portfolio.

## Different ways to allocate capital in a holding company
- Pay down debt
- Pursue an acquisition
- Launch a new product or service
- Grow the team
- Purchase more assets
- Pay out dividends to owners? *Try to keep this to a minimum.*
