Just under a year ago, we opened the doors to Cloud Gallery as a father-son duo with a mutual love for art.

In 12 months, we sold 217 paintings, paid artists over $325,000 in commissions, and became the region's premier art gallery.

Here's how we got started.

**1. Focus only on the best types of businesses**

We were talking about going into business for a while. We said no to a lot of good ideas. We wanted to focus on the [best types of business](/writings/the-best-businesses).

We researched the art gallery market and found a lot to like:

- [x] High margins
- [x] Low startup costs
- [x] Our skills and interests overlapped with what it would take to succeed

**2. Define your key differentiator**

We knew we had to be different.

We lasered in on a very specific mission and branded ourselves around it:

Ontario's Hybrid Art Gallery.


We wanted our art to celebrate Ontario’s beauty. We wanted a collection that evoked memories of summer camp, trips to provincial parks, and days on the dock.

We decided to take a hybrid approach to selling art, allowing customers to interact with each piece online and in person.

**3. Talk to potential customers**

We worked with a designer and interviewed potential customers to build the best website possible.

With the website development underway, we started recruiting artists.

We leaned on connections we had in the local art scene which got us our first 5 artists.

**4. Find out what's most important in the decision to buy**

The customer interviews uncovered that people need to experience the art in person.

They want to feel whether or not it is the right painting for them before making a purchase.

Buying art is an emotional decision and seeing it is crucial.

**5. Be resourceful to keep your costs low**

We needed a physical location.

Keep in mind we wanted to keep costs low so we negotiated an innovative lease structure.

We mitigated the risk and avoided high monthly payments by sharing some of the upside with our landlord.

**6. Figure out the fundamentals of your industry**

Fundamentally, art galleries are relationship businesses.

The strength of an art gallery lies in a combination of your roster of artists and your customer database.

With a top-tier website and a big, beautiful retail space, we got to work on recruiting more artists.

**7. Partner with the best**

We sought out Ontario’s best artists who celebrate the beauty around us. Despite just starting, we went after artists with tens of thousands of followers and pitched ourselves.

We had a very high success rate.

25/28 artists that we reached out to agreed to partner with us.

**8. Create offers that people can't refuse**

We stacked the deck by offering better incentives to work with us.

We did the same for potential customers.

We offer a personalized buying experience that includes fast delivery, a satisfaction guarantee, and custom paintings from our artists.

**To summarize, here's how we started a gallery**

1. Focus on the best types of businesses
2. Define the key differentiators
3. Talk to customers
4. Find out why people buy
5. Keep costs low
6. Nail the industry fundamentals
7. Partner with the best
8. Create offers they can't refuse
