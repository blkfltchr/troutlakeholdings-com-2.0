title: The Games We Play
description: Choosing games we know we can win.

We like to look at the competitive business landscape as a series of games.

Like at the casino, there are games where we have higher odds of winning and games where we have lower odds. We know that we can't control luck, but we can control the games we play.

When the odds are stacked against us, we choose to get up from the table and play a different game.

We like to choose industries that require lower degrees of difficulty to compete. We like businesses where you can differentiate simply by picking up the phone every time it rings.

We look for games like checkers that have fewer variables to control and try to avoid anything that resembles three dimensional chess.

If we can't find a game to our liking, we try to invent a new one.
